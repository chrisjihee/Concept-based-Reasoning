Please extract the following items suggested by the model from the model response output for each of the {num_model} models for the given question and answer set.
1) Model ID:
2) Best (and True) Triple: (if it doesn't exist in the model response, mark them as none)
3) Worst (or False) Triple: (if it doesn't exist in the model response, mark them as none)
4) Answer:
==========
* Question: {question}
==========
* Base Answer: {base_answer}
==========
* Base Triples:
{base_triples}
==========
* Total {num_model} Model Responses:
{model_responses}
==========
