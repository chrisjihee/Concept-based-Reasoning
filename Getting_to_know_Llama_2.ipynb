    "# **Getting to know Llama 2: Everything you need to start building**\n",
    "Our goal in this session is to provide a guided tour of Llama 2, including understanding different Llama 2 models, how and where to access them, Generative AI and Chatbot architectures, prompt engineering, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), Fine-tuning and more. All this is implemented with a starter code for you to take it and use it in your Llama 2 projects."
