Great! I'm ready to demonstrate my ability to structure and retrieve knowledge from the provided knowledge graph. Here's my answer to the given question:

* Question: Analyze the impact of the Columbian Exchange on the global economy, agriculture, and cultural practices.
* Answer: The Columbian Exchange had a profound impact on the global economy, agriculture, and cultural practices. It led to the transfer of crops, animals, and diseases between the Old and New Worlds, revolutionizing food production and trade. For instance, the introduction of potatoes from South America to Europe led to increased food security and population growth in Europe. Additionally, the exchange of crops like maize and beans between the Americas and Africa helped to improve agricultural productivity in many regions. However, the exchange also had negative consequences, such as the devastating impact of European diseases on indigenous populations and the displacement of traditional farming practices.
* Related triples:
	+ Columbian Exchange -> Impact -> Global economy, agriculture, cultural practices
	+ Columbian Exchange -> Transfer -> Crops, animals, diseases
	+ Potatoes -> Introduction -> Europe
	+ Maize -> Introduction -> Americas
	+ Beans -> Introduction -> Africa
