You are tasked with evaluating a set of answers and associated triples provided above.
The evaluation should focus on the following aspects:

1. Accuracy (a):
  - Answer Accuracy: Assess if the provided answer is factually correct.
  - Triple Accuracy: Check if the triples are factually accurate and reflect real-world knowledge.

2. Completeness (b):
  - Answer Completeness: Determine if the answer comprehensively addresses the question without omitting crucial information.
  - Triple Completeness: Ensure that all necessary triples required to support the answer are included.

3. Relevance (c):
  - Answer Relevance: Verify that the answer is directly related to the question.
  - Triple Relevance: Confirm that the triples are pertinent to the provided answer.

4. Consistency (d):
  - Answer Consistency: Ensure that the answer is internally consistent and free of logical contradictions.
  - Triple Consistency: Check for internal consistency among the triples, ensuring no contradictions.

5. Depth of Detail (e):
  - Answer Detail: Evaluate if the answer provides an appropriate level of detail.
  - Triple Detail: Assess if the triples include detailed information necessary to understand the context.

6. Sophistication (f):
  - Answer Sophistication: Judge the answerâ€™s complexity and its ability to handle nuanced or difficult questions.
  - Triple Sophistication: Determine if the triples reflect complex knowledge structures.

7. Hierarchy of Information (g):
  - Answer Hierarchy: Verify that the answer organizes information by importance and relevance.
  - Triple Hierarchy: Ensure that the triples represent a logical and hierarchical structure of information.

8. Context Understanding (h):
  - Answer Context: Assess if the answer demonstrates an understanding of the context of the question.
  - Triple Context: Ensure that the triples reflect a contextual understanding relevant to the answer.

Score each aspect of answer and each aspect of triples on a scale of 0 to 10 (decimals possible).
