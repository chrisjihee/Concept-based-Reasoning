We want to compare how well large-scale language models (LLMs) internally structure and store knowledge via knowledge graphs (KGs).
A knowledge graph typically represents knowledge in the form of triples [format: subject -> relation -> object].
Below is a demo example of such a knowledge graph.

<BEGIN_OF_DEMO_EXAMPLE>
* Target Entity: {demo_entity}
* A set of triples where the subject is the target entity (quantity: {demo_triples_size}):
{demo_triples}
<END_OF_DEMO_EXAMPLE>

Now, we want to test your knowledge structuring ability with this knowledge graph construction ability.
Let's output a triple set where the subject is the target entity, referring to the demo examples above.

<BEGIN_OF_YOUR_OUTPUT>
* Target Entity: {test_entity}
* Triple set where the subject is the target entity (quantity: {test_triples_size}):
(Please output the triple set here)
<END_OF_YOUR_OUTPUT>
