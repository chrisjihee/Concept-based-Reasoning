The following is a test to compare how well large language models (LLMs) structure and store knowledge through knowledge graphs (KGs).
A knowledge graph typically represents knowledge in the form of a triple (subject -> relation -> object), and the following is an example of such a representation.

-----
Marie Curie -> Born -> November 7, 1867, Warsaw, Poland
Marie Curie -> Died -> July 4, 1934 (age 66 years), Passy, France
Marie Curie -> Discovered -> Radium, Polonium
Marie Curie -> Spouse -> Pierre Curie (m. 1895–1906)
Marie Curie -> Buried -> April 20, 1995, Panthéon, Paris, France
Marie Curie -> Education -> University of Paris (1903), University of Paris (1894), MORE
Marie Curie -> Children -> Ève Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie

We want to check your knowledge structuring ability to ensure that you include this knowledge graph well.
Print an answer of around {real_answer_size} words to a given question, along with a triple set containing about {real_knowledge_size} different relationships that reference the answer.
* Question: {real_question}
* Answer(about {real_answer_size} words): (your answer here)
* Related triples(about {real_knowledge_size} relationships): (your knowledge graph triples here)

Below is a demo example of an answer to a question that can be answered based on the knowledge graph above, and a set of related triples to reference in the answer.
* Question: {demo_question}
* Answer(about {demo_answer_size} words): {demo_answer}
* Related triples(about {demo_knowledge_size} relationships):
