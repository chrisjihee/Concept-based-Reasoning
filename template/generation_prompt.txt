We want to compare how well a large-scale language model (LLM) internally structures and stores knowledge through a knowledge graph (KG).
A knowledge graph typically represents knowledge in the form of a triple ["head_entity", "relation", "tail_entity"].
Where a relation is one of the following lists:
{defined_relations}

Here are some demo examples of such a knowledge graph.
{generation_demo_examples}

Now we want to test your knowledge structuring ability with this knowledge graph construction ability.
Let's output a set of triples where the head entity is the target entity, referring to the demo examples above.
Please respond in JSON object format as below.
<generation>
{generation_form}
</generation>
