Socrates' philosophical contributions to Western thought have been profound, particularly in the areas of ethics, politics, and science. He is widely known for his emphasis on logos, which he defined as "the way or means by which one acts." This concept involves using reason and logical thinking to arrive at sound judgments and principles, rather than relying solely on emotions or intuition.

One of Socrates' most significant contributions is his critique of traditional Greek philosophy, which often focused on the idealized forms of gods and heroes. He believed that true wisdom lies not in seeking out external rewards or accolades but in engaging with the world around us and living a virtuous life. By emphasizing the importance of self-examination and dialogue with others, Socrates challenged the notion of fixed moral truths and encouraged individuals to develop their own moral frameworks based on personal experience and virtue.

Socratic questioning was another crucial aspect of Socrates' philosophy. He would engage in deep discussions with his students, asking them questions about their beliefs, values, and actions, and challenging them to think critically about their assumptions and biases. Through these conversations, Socrates sought to uncover hidden assumptions and reveal the limitations of rationality, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of human nature and the world.

In terms of impact on Western thought, Socrates' ideas have had enduring influence on various fields, including ethics, political philosophy, and science. His emphasis on logos has influenced the development of ethical theories such
